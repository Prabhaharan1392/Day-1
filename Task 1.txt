HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2
Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2
HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual
HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
HTTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches
